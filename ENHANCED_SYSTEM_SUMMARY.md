# Enhanced Semantic Text-to-SQL System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The original system had **hardcoded assumptions** that made it inflexible and prone to semantic errors:

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Semantic Accuracy**: Q9 "revenue by product category" used `product_retail_price` (catalog price) instead of `sale_price` (actual revenue)
2. **Hardcoded Context Selection**: Fixed rules like "revenue queries → include order_items" 
3. **Static Field Mappings**: Assumptions about specific table/field names
4. **Limited Schema Flexibility**: Couldn't adapt to different LookML/BigQuery schemas

## 🚀 Dynamic Solution Implemented

### Core Innovation: Schema Intelligence Service
- **Dynamic Field Classification**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to analyze each field's semantic meaning
- **Business Logic Discovery**: Understands measure definitions and their proper usage
- **Intelligent Table Selection**: Selects relevant tables based on business purpose, not name matching
- **Context-Aware Guidance**: Generates schema-specific warnings and recommendations

### Key Components Built:

#### 1. SchemaIntelligenceService (`src/llm/schema_intelligence.py`)
```python
# Semantic field types discovered dynamically
class FieldSemanticType(Enum):
    TRANSACTIONAL_VALUE = "transactional_value"  # Actual money exchanged
    REFERENCE_PRICE = "reference_price"          # Listed/catalog prices
    QUANTITY = "quantity"                        # Counts, amounts, volumes
    IDENTIFIER = "identifier"                    # Keys, IDs, references
    TEMPORAL = "temporal"                        # Dates, timestamps
    CATEGORICAL = "categorical"                  # Classifications, statuses
    DESCRIPTIVE = "descriptive"                  # Names, descriptions
    CALCULATED = "calculated"                    # Derived measures
```

#### 2. EnhancedSchemaContextGenerator (`src/llm/enhanced_schema_context.py`)
- **Query Intent Analysis**: Understands what the user is really asking
- **Intelligent Explore Selection**: Semantic relevance scoring vs. name matching
- **Multi-layered Context**: Query-specific overview → enriched schemas → business logic → warnings
- **Contextual Warnings**: Prevents semantic errors specific to the schema

#### 3. Enhanced LLM Planner Integration (`src/llm/llm_planner.py`)
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to original system if enhanced analysis fails
- **Configurable**: Can toggle enhanced context on/off
- **Performance Optimized**: Caches semantic analysis results

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Query: "Show me revenue by product category"
     ↓
SchemaIntelligenceService
├── Analyzes all fields → TRANSACTIONAL_VALUE vs REFERENCE_PRICE
├── Identifies table business purposes → FACT vs DIMENSION
├── Builds concept mappings → "revenue" → [actual transaction fields]
└── Generates query patterns → revenue calculation guidance
     ↓
EnhancedSchemaContextGenerator  
├── Query intent analysis → "revenue_analysis" type
├── Intelligent table selection → Score by business relevance
├── Multi-layered context → Semantic field categories + warnings
└── Contextual guidance → "Use 💰 fields, avoid 📋 fields"
     ↓
LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
└── Generates semantically correct SQL with enhanced context
```

## 🎯 Results & Impact

### Before (Hardcoded System):
```sql
-- Q9: Show me revenue by product category
SELECT 
    t1.product_category,
    sum(t1.product_retail_price)  -- ❌ WRONG: Uses catalog price
FROM `thelook_ecommerce.model.inventory_items` AS t1
GROUP BY 1
```

### After (Enhanced Semantic System):
```sql
-- Q9: Show me revenue by product category  
SELECT 
    p.category,
    SUM(oi.sale_price)           -- ✅ CORRECT: Uses actual transaction value
FROM `order_items` oi
JOIN `products` p ON oi.product_id = p.id  
GROUP BY 1
```

## 🛡️ Semantic Error Prevention

### Dynamic Warnings Generated:
- **Revenue Field Selection**: "Use 💰 TRANSACTIONAL_VALUE fields, not 📋 REFERENCE_PRICE fields"
- **Table Selection**: "Query requires aggregation but selected tables are dimensional"  
- **Join Requirements**: "Query benefits from joining transaction + reference tables"
- **Common Mistakes**: Field-specific warnings based on actual schema analysis

## 🔧 Schema Agnostic Design

### Flexible Architecture:
- **No Hardcoded Field Names**: Discovers field semantics dynamically
- **No Hardcoded Table Rules**: Analyzes table business purposes  
- **No Static Business Logic**: Generates query patterns from actual schema
- **Adaptive Context**: Adjusts guidance based on available metadata

### Works Across Different Schemas:
- **E-commerce**: orders, products, customers
- **SaaS**: subscriptions, users, events  
- **Finance**: transactions, accounts, portfolios
- **Healthcare**: patients, appointments, treatments

## 📊 Performance & Compatibility

### Intelligent Caching:
- Schema analysis results cached for 1 hour (configurable)
- Semantic classifications persist across queries
- Only re-analyzes when schema changes

### Backward Compatibility:
- Enhanced context can be disabled: `use_enhanced_context=False`
- Falls back to original system on errors
- All existing functionality preserved
- Zero breaking changes

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Key Test Cases:
1. **Revenue vs Retail Price**: Ensures transactional values used for revenue
2. **Customer Analysis**: Proper user/customer table selection  
3. **Time-based Queries**: Correct temporal field identification
4. **Cross-schema Compatibility**: Same logic works across different business domains

### Quality Improvements:
- **Semantic Accuracy**: Correct field selection based on business meaning
- **Context Relevance**: Tables selected by business purpose, not name matching
- **Error Prevention**: Schema-specific warnings prevent common mistakes
- **Adaptability**: Works with any LookML/BigQuery schema structure

## 🚀 Usage

```python
# Enhanced system (default)
engine = TextToSQLEngine()
result = engine.generate_sql("Show me revenue by product category")

# With fallback capability  
engine = TextToSQLEngine()
planner.use_enhanced_context = False  # Disable if needed
```

The enhanced system provides **semantically-aware, schema-agnostic** text-to-SQL generation that adapts to any business domain while preventing critical semantic errors through intelligent analysis of the actual schema metadata.
