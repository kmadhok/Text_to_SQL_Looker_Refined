The user's natural language question\n2. The provided database schema with table relationships, field descriptions, and sample data\n\nKey requirements:\n- Generate syntactically correct BigQuery SQL\n- Use proper table aliases and fully qualified table names\n- Handle complex analytical queries (aggregations, rankings, comparisons)\n- Include appropriate JOINs when data spans multiple tables\n- Use ORDER BY for ranking queries (highest, lowest, maximum, minimum)\n- Add LIMIT clauses for top/bottom N queries\n- Ensure field names exactly match the schema\n- Use appropriate aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)\n- Handle time-based filtering and grouping correctly\n\nFor ranking queries like \"highest sale price\" or \"top products\":\n- Use ORDER BY with DESC for highest/maximum/top\n- Use ORDER BY with ASC for lowest/minimum/bottom  \n- Include LIMIT 1 for single results or LIMIT N for top N\n\nFor \"what product has highest sale price\" type queries:\n- Join order_items (has sale_price) with products (has product details)\n- Include product identification fields (name, id, brand)\n- Order by the metric and limit appropriately\n\nRespond with ONLY the SQL query, no explanations or markdown formatting.",
