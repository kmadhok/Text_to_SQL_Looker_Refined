it is likely a per-unit price and may need to be multiplied by a quantity field.\n- **products.cost** (number)\n  \u2022 The cost for the business to acquire one unit of the product (i.e., cost of goods sold).\n  \u2022 Usage: Calculate gross profit per unit by subtracting it from the actual sale price (from an orders table).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Confusing it with the selling price ('retail_price').\n\n## \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Categories & Classifications:\n- **order_items.status** (string)\n  \u2022 Indicates the current stage of the fulfillment lifecycle for this specific order item (e.g., 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Returned').\n  \u2022 Usage: Filter reports to see items in a specific state (e.g., count of items pending shipment).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using this field in numerical aggregations like SUM or AVG.\n- **users.city** (string)\n  \u2022 The city where the user resides or has provided as their location.\n  \u2022 Usage: Grouping users by geographic location for regional analysis.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming data cleanliness; values like 'New York', 'NYC', and 'new york' might exist and need to be standardized.\n- **users.country** (string)\n  \u2022 The country where the user resides or has provided as their location.\n  \u2022 Usage: High-level geographic segmentation of the user base.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Inconsistent naming conventions or use of codes (e.g., 'USA', 'United States', 'US').\n- **users.gender** (string)\n  \u2022 The gender identity of the user as provided by them.\n  \u2022 Usage: Segmenting users for demographic analysis.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming a binary set of values (e.g., 'Male'/'Female') without accounting for nulls, 'Other', or 'Prefer not to say'.\n- **users.postal_code** (string)\n  \u2022 The postal or ZIP code for the user's address, used for mail delivery and geographic grouping.\n  \u2022 Usage: Grouping users by a more granular location than city.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Treating it as a number and performing mathematical operations on it (e.g., averaging ZIP codes is meaningless).\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 Date & Time Fields:\n- **order_items.created** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the order item was created in the system, typically representing the moment of purchase.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use as the primary date for analyzing sales trends over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly revenue).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Failing to handle timezones correctly, which can lead to inaccurate daily aggregations.\n- **order_items.delivered** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the item was successfully delivered to the customer.\n  \u2022 Usage: Calculate the total shipping and delivery time by subtracting the 'shipped' timestamp.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this field is never NULL; it will be empty for items not yet delivered.\n- **order_items.returned** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when a previously delivered item was received back by the company as a return.\n  \u2022 Usage: Analyze return rates by product, category, or time period.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this field is never NULL; it will be empty for items that were not returned.\n- **order_items.shipped** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the item was dispatched from the warehouse and handed over to a shipping carrier.\n  \u2022 Usage: Calculate fulfillment processing time by subtracting the 'created' timestamp.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this field is never NULL; it will be empty for items not yet shipped.\n- **users.created** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the user's account was created or registered.\n  \u2022 Usage: Analyzing user growth over time (e.g., new users per month).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Forgetting to handle or specify timezones, leading to incorrect daily or hourly groupings.\n\n## \ud83e\uddee Calculated Measures:\n- **order_items.count** (count)\n  \u2022 A computed metric representing the total count of order line items.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use as a key performance indicator (KPI) to measure the volume of items sold.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Confusing this with a 'quantity' field. This counts the number of rows (line items), not the number of units within each row.\n- **users.count** (count)\n  \u2022 A pre-defined calculation to count the total number of unique user records.\n  \u2022 Usage: As a primary metric to measure the size of the user base.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Confusing it with a count of activities or transactions; this field counts unique users only.\n- **products.count** (count)\n  \u2022 A calculated measure representing the total number of distinct products (or rows) in a given context.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use to count the number of products, for example, 'Count of Products per Brand'.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Confusing this with a sum of inventory quantity. This is a count of product records, not the number of items in stock.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Quantities & Counts:\n- **users.age** (number)\n  \u2022 Represents the age of the user in years, typically at the time of registration or last update.\n  \u2022 Usage: Segmenting users into demographic age groups (e.g., 18-24, 25-34).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming the age is always current; it's often a static value from a point in time.\n- **users.latitude** (number)\n  \u2022 The geographic latitude coordinate of the user's location, used for precise mapping.\n  \u2022 Usage: Plotting user locations on a map visualization.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it in isolation without its corresponding longitude.\n- **users.longitude** (number)\n  \u2022 The geographic longitude coordinate of the user's location, used for precise mapping.\n  \u2022 Usage: Plotting user locations on a map visualization.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it in isolation without its corresponding latitude.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Names & Descriptions:\n- **users.first_name** (string)\n  \u2022 The user's given or first name.\n  \u2022 Usage: Personalizing communications and user interfaces (e.g., 'Hello, John').\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it for unique identification, as many users share the same first name.\n- **users.last_name** (string)\n  \u2022 The user's family or last name.\n  \u2022 Usage: Personalizing communications and user interfaces.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it for unique identification.\n- **users.street_address** (string)\n  \u2022 The specific street address of the user, including house number and street name.\n  \u2022 Usage: For operational purposes like shipping and billing.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it for grouping in analysis, which is ineffective due to its extremely high cardinality.\n- **products.name** (string)\n  \u2022 The customer-facing title or name of the product.\n  \u2022 Usage: Display in reports, tables, and dashboards to identify products in a human-readable way.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it as a unique identifier; product names can change or be duplicated.\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Reference Prices (Catalog/Listed Prices):\n- **products.retail_price** (number)\n  \u2022 The standard listed selling price of the product to a customer before any discounts, promotions, or taxes.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use to understand the catalog pricing of products.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using it to calculate actual, realized revenue. Actual revenue must be calculated from a sales or order_items table which contains the final price paid.\n\n# Explore: thelook_ecommerce.model.inventory_items\n\n## Business Context:\n- Base table 'inventory_items': To track the lifecycle and key attributes of each individual inventory item from the moment it is received into stock until it is sold.\n- This is a FACT table - contains transactional/measurable data\n- Single table explore - no joins available\n- Best for: Calculating inventory aging and turnover rates by analyzing the time difference between 'created' and 'sold' dates., Determining the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for specific periods by summing the 'cost' of items sold within a date range., Analyzing current inventory levels and value by filtering for items where the 'sold' date is null., Tracking the flow of items through specific distribution centers and analyzing product performance by location.\n- Avoid for: Analyzing detailed sales transactions, as this table lacks order ID, customer ID, actual sale price, or discounts., High-frequency, real-time stock level checks for operational systems, as it's structured for analytical reporting rather than transactional lookups., Custo\n\n...

These should be queried from their respective dimension tables by joining on the ID., Getting a simple list of all unique customers or all available products; the `users` or `products` tables are far more efficient for this.\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 Identifiers & Keys:\n- **order_items.id** (number)\n  \u2022 A unique system-generated identifier for each individual line item within a customer's order.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use as a primary key to uniquely identify each record in this table.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Summing or averaging this field, which is mathematically meaningless.\n- **order_items.inventory_item_id** (number)\n  \u2022 A reference to the specific physical stock unit that was allocated to fulfill this order line item.\n  \u2022 Usage: Join to an inventory table to get details about a specific item's stock, such as warehouse location or cost of goods sold (COGS).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Summing or averaging this ID.\n- **order_items.order_id** (number)\n  \u2022 A reference that groups multiple order items together into a single customer transaction or order.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use to join to an 'orders' table to get order-level information like shipping address or total order value.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Summing or averaging this ID.\n- **order_items.product_id** (number)\n  \u2022 A reference to the specific product from the company's catalog that was purchased.\n  \u2022 Usage: Join to a 'products' table to get descriptive attributes like product name, brand, or category.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Summing or averaging this ID.\n- **order_items.user_id** (number)\n  \u2022 A reference to the customer account that placed the order containing this item.\n  \u2022 Usage: Join to a 'users' table to get customer demographic information.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Summing or averaging this ID.\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Transaction Values (Actual Revenue/Money):\n- **order_items.sale_price** (number)\n  \u2022 The actual price per unit that the customer paid for this item in this specific transaction, after any discounts or promotions.\n  \u2022 Usage: Sum this field to calculate gross revenue.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this is the total line item price; it is likely a per-unit price and may need to be multiplied by a quantity field.\n- **products.cost** (number)\n  \u2022 The cost for the business to acquire one unit of the product (i.e., cost of goods sold).\n  \u2022 Usage: Calculate gross profit per unit by subtracting it from the actual sale price (from an orders table).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Confusing it with the selling price ('retail_price').\n\n## \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Categories & Classifications:\n- **order_items.status** (string)\n  \u2022 Indicates the current stage of the fulfillment lifecycle for this specific order item (e.g., 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Returned').\n  \u2022 Usage: Filter reports to see items in a specific state (e.g., count of items pending shipment).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Using this field in numerical aggregations like SUM or AVG.\n- **users.city** (string)\n  \u2022 The city where the user resides or has provided as their location.\n  \u2022 Usage: Grouping users by geographic location for regional analysis.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming data cleanliness; values like 'New York', 'NYC', and 'new york' might exist and need to be standardized.\n- **users.country** (string)\n  \u2022 The country where the user resides or has provided as their location.\n  \u2022 Usage: High-level geographic segmentation of the user base.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Inconsistent naming conventions or use of codes (e.g., 'USA', 'United States', 'US').\n- **users.gender** (string)\n  \u2022 The gender identity of the user as provided by them.\n  \u2022 Usage: Segmenting users for demographic analysis.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming a binary set of values (e.g., 'Male'/'Female') without accounting for nulls, 'Other', or 'Prefer not to say'.\n- **users.postal_code** (string)\n  \u2022 The postal or ZIP code for the user's address, used for mail delivery and geographic grouping.\n  \u2022 Usage: Grouping users by a more granular location than city.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Treating it as a number and performing mathematical operations on it (e.g., averaging ZIP codes is meaningless).\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 Date & Time Fields:\n- **order_items.created** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the order item was created in the system, typically representing the moment of purchase.\n  \u2022 Usage: Use as the primary date for analyzing sales trends over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly revenue).\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Failing to handle timezones correctly, which can lead to inaccurate daily aggregations.\n- **order_items.delivered** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the item was successfully delivered to the customer.\n  \u2022 Usage: Calculate the total shipping and delivery time by subtracting the 'shipped' timestamp.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this field is never NULL; it will be empty for items not yet delivered.\n- **order_items.returned** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when a previously delivered item was received back by the company as a return.\n  \u2022 Usage: Analyze return rates by product, category, or time period.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this field is never NULL; it will be empty for items that were not returned.\n- **order_items.shipped** (time)\n  \u2022 The exact date and time when the item was dispatched from the warehouse and handed over to a shipping carrier.\n  \u2022 Usage: Calculate fulfillment processing time by subtracting the 'created' timestamp.\n  \u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f Avoid: Assuming this field is never NULL;
